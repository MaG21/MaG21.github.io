<p>
I'm a solution-oriented developer, I avoid complex solutions like the plage.
</p>

<strong>2013 - 2017 (Ruby, C, Python and JavaScript)</strong>
<p>
I co-founded a <a target="_blank" href="https://marcos.do">Tech Startup</a> in Santo Domingo.
One big project we did was done in partnership with <a href="https://www.visanetdominicana.com/nosotros">VisaNet Dominicana</a>. In this project
I was responsible of the low-level API between POS terminals and the core system which
currently handles 3k+ requests/h. [<a href="https://www.visanetdominicana.com/productos-y-servicios/pos/soluciones-en-terminal/ncf-pos">Service</a>].

<strong>2016 (Ruby on Rails, AWS)</strong>
<p>
TravelWise, locally the biggest player in the travel category, here I was part of a small multidisciplinary team building a <a href="https://travelwise.com.do/hoteles-republica-dominicana">Booking Engine</a>. Later on I implemented a simple web scrapper
that finds currency rates of many financial institution. This scrapper is being used by several companies. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MaG21/curry">Repo</a>.
</p>


<strong>2018 (Ruby on Rails, PHP, Swift, AWS)</strong>
<p>
In may 7th, I started working a full time job at Publicis Dominicana, part of
Publicis Groupe, the worldâ€™s third largest advertising communication network.
Here I work as a Sr Software developer. At Publicis I work developing simpler software,
in principle, yet more polished, fully designed and applying UX principles.
</p>

<strong>2019 (Swift)</strong>
<p>
June 5th, I developed along side two amazing co-workers a native MacOS app
for photographers. Note that this is a personal project for us, a lot of thought was put in while making this simple application.

<p>
For this app we applied many UX principles and did lots of usability testing with REAL users.

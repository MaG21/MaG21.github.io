<p>
I'm a passionate software developer that enjoys delivering robust software.
</p>

<strong>2013</strong>
<p>
At age 24 I had initiated my <a target="_blank" href="https://marcos.do">own startup</a>, in which one of the most challenging
projects we developed was a huge software commissioned by VisaNet Dominicana, one of the
leading electronic payment service provider in the country. As part of my responsibilities, I was in
charge of the low level communication between POS terminals and the internal
system implemented with Ruby, which currently handles a couple thousand requests per day.

<strong>2016</strong>
<p>
I started working with TravelWise the biggest player in the travel category and
the only travel agency member of the reputed Virtuoso global network in the
Dominican Republic, where I was in charge of building the back-end of a
small-scale <a href="https://travelwise.com.do/hoteles-republica-dominicana">Booking Engine</a>. Later on I had to create a service that
consolidates the exchange rate for several currencies into one API. to achieve
this, I developed a scrapper. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MaG21/curry">Repo</a>.
</p>


<strong>2018</strong>
<p>
In may 7th, I started working a full time job at Publicis Dominicana, part of
Publicis Groupe, the worldâ€™s third largest advertising communication network.
Here I work as a backend developer. At Publicis I work
developing simpler software, in principle, yet more polished, fully designed
and applying UX principles.

<strong>2019</strong>
<p>
June 5th, I developed along side two amazing co-workers a native MacOS app
for photographers. Note that this is a personal project for us, a lot of thought was put while making this simple application.

<p>
For this app we applied many UX principles and did lots of usability testing with REAL users.

<p>
A rough summary of what I've been doing
</p>

<strong>2013</strong>
<p>
I co-founded a <a target="_blank" href="https://marcos.do">Startup</a> in Santo Domingo.
One big project we did was done in partnership with <a href="https://www.visanetdominicana.com/nosotros">VisaNet Dominicana</a>. In this project
I was responsible of the low level API with Ruby, currently it handles ~4k req/h. <a href="https://www.visanetdominicana.com/productos-y-servicios/pos/soluciones-en-terminal/ncf-pos">Service</a>.
</p>

<strong>2016</strong>
<p>
TravelWise, one of the biggest player in the travel category, here I was part of a small multidisciplinary team building a <a href="https://travelwise.com.do/hoteles-republica-dominicana">Booking Engine</a> with Ruby on Rails and AWS.
</p>

<strong>2018</strong>
<p>
Few months after selling my half of Marcos, I started working a full time job at Publicis Dominicana, part of
Publicis Groupe, the worldâ€™s third largest advertising communication network.
Here I work as a Sr Software developer. Working with Cloud Services and along with an incredible team.
</p>

<strong>2019</strong>
<p>
Along side two amazing co-workers we created a native MacOS app
for photographers. Note that this is a personal project for us, a lot of thought was put in while making this simple application.

</p>

<p>
For this app we applied many UX principles and did lots of usability testing with REAL users.

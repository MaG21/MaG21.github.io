<p>
I'm a passionate software developer that enjoys delivering robust software.
</p>

<strong>2013</strong>
<p>
At age 24 I had initiated my <a target="_blank" href="https://marcos.do">own company</a>, in which one of the most challenging
projects we developed was a huge software commissioned by VisaNet Dominicana, the
leading electronic payment service provider of the most prestigious banks and
financial institutions in the country. As part of my responsibilities, I was in
charge of the low level communication between POS terminals and the internal
system of the service, which currently handles a couple thousand requests per day.

<strong>2016</strong>
<p>
I started working with TravelWise the biggest player in the travel category and
the only travel agency member of the reputed Virtuoso global network in the
Dominican Republic, where I was in charge of building the back-end of a
small-scale <a href="https://travelwise.com.do/hoteles-republica-dominicana">Booking Engine</a>. Later on I had to create a service that
consolidates the exchange rate for several currencies into one API. to achieve
this, I developed a scrapper. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MaG21/curry">Repo</a>.

<strong>2018</strong>
<p>
In may 7th, I started working a full time job at Publicis Dominicana, part of
Publicis Groupe, the world’s third largest advertising communication network.
Here I work doing iOS development and web development for top local clients in
beverages, retail, finance and other major categories. At Publicis I work
developing simpler software, in principle, yet more polished, fully designed
and applying UX principles.
</p>

<p>
As part of the developing changes in the business, I’m also helping a team
launching Digitas Dominicana office. Digitas is a digital marketing agency,
part of Publicis Media, one of four solution hubs within Publicis Groupe and it
operates in over 25 countries. This achievement will help us offer our clients
more robust solutions across digital media and software development.

<strong>2019</strong>
<p>
June 5th, I developed along side two amazing co-workers a native MacOS app
for photographers. Note that this is a personal project for us.

<p>
For this app we applied many UX principles and did lots of usability testing with REAL users.

<p>
I'm a passionate software developer that enjoys delivering robust software.
</p>

<strong>2013</strong>
<p>
I had my <a target="_blank" href="https://marcos.do">own company</a>,
where we, built a huge software commissioned by VisaNet Dominica. It was a service
where I was in charge of the low level communication between POS terminals and the
internal system. This service currently handles a couple thoudsand requests per
day. <a href="https://www.visanetdominicana.com/productos-y-servicios/pos/soluciones-en-terminal/ncf-pos">Service</a>.
</p>

<strong>2016</strong>
<p>
I started working with a travel agency, where I was in charge of building
the back-end of a small <a href="https://travelwise.com.do/hoteles-republica-dominicana">Booking Engine</a>.
<br>
Later on I had to create a service that consolidates the exchange rate for several
currencies into one API, to achieve this, I developed a scrapper. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MaG21/curry">Repo</a>.
</p>


<strong>2018</strong>
<p>
In may 7th, I stated working a full time job at an adverticing agency called
Publicis Dominicana. Here I work doing iOS development and web development.
</p>

<p>
At Publicis I work developing simpler software, in principle, yet more polished,
fully designed and applying UX principles.
</p>

<strong>2019</strong>
<p>
June 5th, I developed along side two amazing co-workers a native MacOS app
for photographers. Note that this is a personal project for us.

For this app we applied many UX principles and did lost of usability testing with REAL users.

## Background

Currently I work with an incredible team of 5 people (myself included) comprised of 2 Developers, 1 UX, 1 UI and an Scrum Master. 

After some time seeing how our skills complement, three of us decided to work on a personal project. That's how we end up working with Erabo Pre-Selector.

Unfortunately we're not enough people to work using scrum, so we had to distribute the work:

1. Chris – UI/UX and everything concerning the website, usability, look and feel.
2. Manuel – Develop the MacOS App, bug fixes and apply changes suggested by Chris and users.
3. Ivan – He is in charge of developing Erabo Gallery, a place whee people would upload their photo sessions and share with clients directly from the app.

Note: As of time of writing, Erabo Gallery is under development.

## App

Erabo Pre-Selector is a native MacOS application I developed along side two other amazing colleges, one of them, Chris, has a [Website](https://chrisvpr.com/).

With Erabo Pre-Selector, photographers can quickly pre-select out of hundreds or even thousand images in minimal time. It includes a built-in pre-selection flow, support for RAW images and can be used to stamp watermarks in bulk. On top of that, it's crazy fast.
